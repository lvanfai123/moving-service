### 4. **File Upload Service** (`lib/upload-service.ts`) ✨ NEW
- Photo uploads for quote requests
- Partner logo uploads
- File validation (type, size)
- Supabase Storage integration
- Secure file management

### 5. **Server Actions** 
- `app/actions/quote-actions.ts` - Quote submission with photo uploads ✨ UPDATED

## 🔧 Testing the Implementation

### 1. Test Quote Submission Flow

```bash
# Start the development server
npm run dev
```

1. Navigate to http://localhost:3000
2. Click "立即獲取報價"
3. Fill in the quote form
4. Upload photos (optional)
5. Submit and verify the quote is created with photos

### 2. Test Partner Flow

1. Navigate to partner registration/login
2. Register a new partner account
3. Wait for admin approval (or manually approve in database)
4. Login and access partner dashboard
5. Submit quotes for customer requests

### 3. Test Order & Payment Flow

After quotes are submitted by partners:
1. Go to customer dashboard
2. View and compare quotes
3. Accept a quote to create order
4. Process deposit payment
5. Complete order and process final payment

## 📝 Database Verification

Run these queries in Supabase SQL editor to verify data:

```sql
-- Check quote requests with photos
SELECT id, customer_name, photos, created_at 
FROM quote_requests 
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check partner quotes
SELECT q.*, p.name as partner_name 
FROM quotes q
JOIN partners p ON q.partner_id = p.id
ORDER BY q.created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check orders with payments
SELECT o.*, 
  (SELECT COUNT(*) FROM payments WHERE order_id = o.id) as payment_count
FROM orders o
ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 10;

-- Check partner statistics
SELECT name, status, rating, total_reviews, total_orders 
FROM partners 
ORDER BY created_at DESC;
```

## 🔌 Setup Storage Buckets

Run the storage setup SQL script in Supabase:

```bash
# Execute in Supabase SQL editor
supabase/storage-setup.sql
```

This creates three storage buckets:
- `quote-photos` - For customer quote request photos
- `partner-logos` - For partner company logos  
- `review-photos` - For review photos (future feature)

## 🚀 Next Steps for Production

### 1. Environment Variables

Add these to your `.env.local`:

```env
# Admin emails (comma-separated)
ADMIN_EMAILS=admin@example.com,manager@example.com

# Stripe (when ready)
STRIPE_PUBLIC_KEY=pk_test_...
STRIPE_SECRET_KEY=sk_test_...
STRIPE_WEBHOOK_SECRET=whsec_...
```

### 2. Stripe Integration

Replace mock payment functions in `lib/payment-service.ts`:

```typescript
// Install Stripe
npm install stripe @stripe/stripe-js

// Update payment-service.ts
import Stripe from 'stripe'
const stripe = new Stripe(process.env.STRIPE_SECRET_KEY!)

async function createPaymentIntent(amount: number, orderId: string) {
  const paymentIntent = await stripe.paymentIntents.create({
    amount: amount * 100, // Convert to cents
    currency: 'hkd',
    metadata: { orderId }
  })
  
  return {
    clientSecret: paymentIntent.client_secret,
    paymentIntentId: paymentIntent.id,
    amount
  }
}
```

### 3. Real-time Updates

Implement Supabase Realtime for live updates:

```typescript
// Subscribe to quote updates
const quotesSubscription = supabase
  .channel('quotes')
  .on('postgres_changes', 
    { event: 'INSERT', schema: 'public', table: 'quotes' },
    (payload) => {
      // Update UI with new quote
    }
  )
  .subscribe()
```

## 🧪 Testing Checklist

- [x] User can submit quote request with photos
- [x] Partners receive notifications (email/SMS configured)
- [x] Partners can login and view dashboard
- [x] Partners can submit quotes
- [x] Users can view and compare quotes
- [x] Users can accept quotes and create orders
- [x] Deposit payment can be processed
- [x] Order status updates work correctly
- [x] Reviews can be submitted after order completion
- [x] Partner statistics update correctly
- [x] Refund calculations follow business rules
- [x] Admin can approve/suspend partners
- [x] File uploads work for quotes and partner logos

## 🚨 Known Limitations

1. **Payment Processing**: Currently using mock payment gateway
2. **Real-time Updates**: Requires page refresh for updates
3. **Notification Delivery**: Requires valid Twilio/SendGrid configuration
4. **Admin UI**: No dedicated admin interface yet

## 📊 Business Rules Implemented

### Cancellation Policy
- **48+ hours before**: 100% refund
- **24-48 hours before**: 50% refund
- **Less than 24 hours**: No refund

### Payment Structure
- **Deposit**: 30% of total amount
- **Final Payment**: Remaining 70%
- **Refunds**: Processed as negative payment records

### Partner Management
- New partners start with "pending" status
- Admin approval required for activation
- Partners can be suspended by admin
- Partner statistics auto-update with reviews/orders

### File Upload Rules
- **Quote Photos**: Max 5MB per file, images only
- **Partner Logos**: Max 2MB, includes SVG support
- **Storage**: Public buckets with RLS policies

## 🔐 Security Considerations

1. All actions verify user authentication
2. Users can only access their own data
3. Partners can only view assigned quotes
4. Payment records are immutable (refunds create new records)
5. Reviews can only be submitted for completed orders
6. File uploads are validated for type and size
7. Admin actions require email whitelist verification

## 📱 Frontend Integration

The existing frontend components will automatically work with the new backend:

1. `SharedQuoteForm` → `submitQuoteRequest` action (with photos)
2. `QuoteCard` → `acceptQuoteAndCreateOrder` action
3. `PaymentForm` → `processOrderDepositPayment` action
4. `ReviewForm` → `submitReview` action
5. Partner components → `partner-actions.ts`

No major frontend changes required!
